# TON Bitstream

TON is officially POS and cannot be mined.
However, the TON bitstream can also be used with TON Tokens.
The current list of mine able TON tokens includes: GRAM, CHAPA, and GPU
** GPU has officially moved to what I call POP, or Proof of Purchase in which an NFT or equivilent has to be bought with the coin to mine more.
