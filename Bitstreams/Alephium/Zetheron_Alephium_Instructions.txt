FILE DESCRIPTIONS
    alephium_bits   -> directory that stores all the bitstreams for each card type
    changeVoltage   -> external executable that changes voltage (run automatically by Zethminer)
    loadAll.sh      -> script that you can execute to program all cards on your system
    nextjag         -> free unlicensed version of nextjtag run internally by Zethminer to detect which cards are on the system
    openFPGALoader  -> custom modification of freeware program, adjusted to program crypto card bitstreams,
                       run in the background by Zethminer
    Zethminer_Alephium_Instructions.txt   -> this file
    startMiner.sh   -> an example loop-launch file you can use to execute Zethminer, described more below
    ZetheronAlephiumV2.1 -> executable file of the miner

OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS                   
    The "libftdi1-2" library is required for using the automatic bitstream programming function; please run command line below to install it:
         sudo apt-get install libftdi1-2 -y

    Next run these commands, once only, to set file permissions:
             chmod -x  *

    1. Direct command line launch method
        Step 1: Open a Terminal
            Open a terminal window on your Ubuntu system. Ubuntu 16,18,20 have been tested.  Ubuntu 22 might work.
            
        Step 2: Navigate to the ZetheronAlephiumV2.1 Directory.  If necessary run:
            chmod -x *
            
        Step 3: Run ZetheronAlephiumV2.1 on the command line as follows:
            sudo ./ZetheronAlephiumV2.1 -o "Alephium_Pool" -u "Alephium_Wallet" --max-temp="max_temp" -t "clock1,clock2,clock3,clock4...clockN" -v "vccint" -l "loadBitVol" --skip "skipCommand"
            Replace:
                "Alephium_Pool" with your pool
                "Alephium_Wallet" with your wallet address
                "max_temp" with your maximum temperature ( recommend from 65 to 90 )
                "clock" with your starting FPGA clock (if using multiple clocks, separate with commas like -t 450,450,500,500 )
                "vccint" with your desired FPGA Core Voltage (recommended 650)
                "skipCommand" with 
                               0 : change voltage/vccInt and program bitstreams before mining
                               1 : load bitstream only before mining (don't change voltage/vccInt)
                               2 : don't change voltage or program bitstreams before mining
                "loadBitVol" with value 6 or 15 
                    6  means program bitstreams with jtag clock 6 MHz
                    15 means program bitstreams with jtag clock 15 MHz (faster loading)
                    By detault the jtag clock is 6 MHz

                Example:   ./ZetheronAlephiumV2.1 -o stratum+tcp://us.vipor.net:5051 -u 1ueouD2tTePMuXpkeTpXcahwgjGhDBMcWrR3ZS4zuNWh.ZetheronAlphium --max-temp=80 -t 700 -l 15 -v 650 -p 4 --skip 1


    2. Separated command line launch method
        You can manually separate the steps of programming the bistreams & launching the miner, for advanced users, like this:
            sudo ./loadAll.sh 6 --enable        (program the bitstreams)
            (then run the miner with --skip 2 to avoid changing voltage or programming bitstreams)
            sudo  ./ZetheronAlephiumV2.1 -o stratum+tcp://us.vipor.net:5051 -u 1ueouD2tTePMuXpkeTpXcahwgjGhDBMcWrR3ZS4zuNWh.ZetheronAlphium --max-temp=80 -t 700 -l 15 -v 650 -p 4 --skip 2 


    3. Pre-made launch script execution method
        In this method, you will edit startMiner.sh for your own personal settings & preferences, then you will simply launch the script:
        > startMiner.sh
        
        In startMiner.sh, you will see a number of fields you need to change to your preference:
        wallet=1ueouD2tTePMuXpkeTpXcahwgjGhDBMcWrR3ZS4zuNWh
        pool=stratum+tcp://us.vipor.net:5051
        workerID=ZetheronAlphium
        maxtemp=80
        clock=700
        vccInt=650
        skipCommand=1

        These fields are then automatically plugged onto the command line when the script launches Zethminer in a loop.
    

WHILE MINING    
    
While mining, the following hot keys can be used to execute certain functions:

ctrl c : exit miner by reduce clock gradually
ctrl z : exit miner by reduce clock gradually
esc    : exit miner by reduce clock gradually
+      : raise clock 10 MHz for all FPGA(s)
-      : reduce clock 10 MHz for all FPGA(s)

E300 Users
If you have E300/E335/E333/E100, please update the firmware from the Osprey Web-GUI and visit the Osprey discord, as 
the E300 uses different internal firmware.
